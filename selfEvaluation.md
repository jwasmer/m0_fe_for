# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I feel relatively fluent. I'm still a little bit confused about whether it's good or bad to have things interact between in the inside of the for statement and the rest of my code. I think I have a decent understanding of how the for statement works, though, and I've been able to use it in the exercises without much difficulty.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I thought this exercise felt great, I enjoy the increased difficulty (so far!).

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I still need to practice with Git and GitHub. I'm trying to be more thorough with my commits but I find when I get "in the zone" programming it totally breaks my concentration to stop and write a commit. It's important to get in the habit of, though, so I'm trying to be better.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

None so far! The documentation for the for statements was SUPER helpful. The specific definitions of each part made understanding it a lot easier.
